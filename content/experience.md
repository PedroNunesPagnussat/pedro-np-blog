I've been working with machine learning, data, and AI for the past 5 years, and I’m always motivated by building practical solutions to real problems. Whether it's developing models, improving workflows, or experimenting with new ideas, I enjoy the process of creating tools that are both smart and useful.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about learning new things, whether it’s through reading, exploring new technologies, or diving into a great video game. I also love to travel and find a lot of inspiration in experiencing different cultures and perspectives.

This portfolio is a collection of projects I’ve built, experiments I’ve explored, and lessons I’ve picked up along the way. I'm always open to connecting, learning from others, and building something great together.

If you're working on something interesting, want to collaborate, or just have a question — don’t hesitate to reach out.
