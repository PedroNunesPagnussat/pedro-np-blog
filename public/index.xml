      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with machine learning, data, and AI for the past 5 years, and I’m always motivated by building practical solutions to real problems. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s developing models, improving workflows, or experimenting with new ideas, I enjoy the process of creating tools that are both smart and useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, I’m passionate about learning new things, whether it’s through reading, exploring new technologies, or diving into a great video game. I also love to travel and find a lot of inspiration in experiencing different cultures and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
